        The two hotels (Marriott and Jen) are located near HKU. A direct taxi journey from the Hong Kong airport to the Courtyard Marriott will take approximately 40 minutes and cost around HKD400, utilizing the Western Harbour Tunnel route. It is important to note that taxis in Hong Kong are color-coded based on their operating areas. To reach the hotel, situated on "Hong Kong Island," please ensure you select the "Hong Kong Island" taxi line and board a red taxi. Additionally, please be aware that taxis in Hong Kong accept only HKD cash. If cash is not readily available, you may consider using Uber as an alternative option.
